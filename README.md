## Lil Bird Fly Home
A cozy screen runner made by June Adams and Bethany Lynn.

### Description
Lil Bird is just trying to fly peacefully through her forest, enjoying the sounds and sights of nature. But a group of
loud and messy humans are disrupting her peaceful afternoon with their human party. How rude! Their balloons and 
snacks are getting everywhere, and Lil Bird needs to be careful as she flies home.
Maybe she should send these humans a little message, in the form of a dropping, so they know better than to litter
in her home!

### Functionality & Gameplay
This game was built using React and Canvas.

### Languages used
React & JavaScript.

### Inspiration
We have already partnered together in the past on bird related games, and felt like keeping up with the bird theme 
would be a fun way to introduce ourselves to the React Jam for the first time!
We are both big fans of animals, and enjoy learning things about birds. 
When we learned about React Jam, neither of us had any prior experience to any form of game development, but wanted to 
take this as an opportunity to geek-out about things we already enjoy, while learning new and valuable skills. 

Coding and learning should be fun, albeit sometimes stressful and full of unknowns, but growth can't happen
until new things are tried!
