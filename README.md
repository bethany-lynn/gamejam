### Description ‚≠ê
Lil Bird is just trying to fly peacefully through her forest, enjoying the sounds and sights of nature. But a group of
loud and messy humans are disrupting her peaceful afternoon with their human party. How rude! Their balloons and 
snacks are getting everywhere, and Lil Bird needs to be careful as she flies home.
Maybe she should send these humans a little message, in the form of a dropping, so they know better than to litter
in her home!

### Getting Started :video_game:
To run the game locally:
- Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: " git clone https://github.com/bethany-lynn/gamejam.git "
- Change into the project directory: "cd gamejam"
- Install the required npm dependencies: " npm install "
- Once installation is complete, start the game with " npm start "
- Open your broswer and visit http://localhost:3000 to play the game
- Have fun and play! Enjoy our Lil Bird and all her bugs. :bug:

### Technologies :computer:
- This game was built using React and Canvas.

This is a fun and interactive game called "Lil Bird Party Game" built using React, Canvas, and JavaScript. 
In the game, players control a bird and try to shoot down various targets with bird poop while avoiding obstacles(balloons).

- **React:** The game's user interface and components are built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Canvas:** The game's visual elements, animations, and interactions are created using the HTML5 Canvas element, allowing for dynamic rendering of graphics.

- **JavaScript:** The game logic and interactivity are implemented using JavaScript, providing the necessary functionality for the game to run smoothly.

## Building Process :hammer:
The game development process involved combining the power of React for managing the application state and user interface, along with the versatility of Canvas for rendering the game's graphics. Key components and hooks were created to handle the bird's movement, projectile firing, and collision detection with targets and obstacles.
Additionally, the game uses various controllers (ProjectileController, PoofController, TargetController, ObstacleController) to manage the game elements, their interactions, and animations.

### Inspiration :sparkles:
We have already partnered together in the past on bird related games, and felt like keeping up with the bird theme 
would be a fun way to introduce ourselves to the React Jam for the first time!
We are both big fans of animals, and enjoy learning things about birds. 
When we learned about React Jam, neither of us had any prior experience to any form of game development, but wanted to 
take this as an opportunity to geek-out about things we already enjoy, while learning new and valuable skills. 

Coding and learning should be fun, albeit sometimes stressful and full of unknowns, but growth can't happen
until new things are tried!
